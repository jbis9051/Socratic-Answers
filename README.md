This project has been archived. I shut this project down because I did not see much of a future in it.  I started Socratic Answers for very similar reasons as the [Codidact](https://codidact.org/) was created. However, I strongly disagreed with how a new Q&A site should be built. I decided to split off of the Codidact project and build my own.  If you are looking to contribute to an open source Q&A site, I suggest you head over to Codidact.
